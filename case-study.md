  1. **Introduction:** Ebay is an online auction and shopping website that allows individuals to purchase goods and services worldwide.

In this UX report,I will focus primarily on the landing page for Ebay. 


2. **Methodology:** We will utilize a heuristic evaluation approach to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the UX and UI of the site. Then come up with some recommendations.



3. **Good UX Findings:** The website mimics the real world by using non technical language. They also have a shopping cart on the landing page which is universally recognisable. It also allows the user to "sign in" or "register" at the top of the page like most websites. It also has a "search" box which allows the user to search the entire website for their interest.



4. **Bad UX Findings:** The website however fails when it comes to aesthetics and the minimalistic design paradigm. There are moving banners and advertising all over the landing page.

My initial reaction after opening the page was total chaos and very cluttered.This is even more evident especially after I had just experienced or studied the Memento and Perfect Recipes. The user experience from interacting with those two and the Ebay website is like comparing night and day.

For instance, those two had a minimalistic approach to their landing pages with a soft and smooth navigation. They both have a smooth and elegant approach when you scroll up or down. Ebay on the other hand is jarring and dizzying when you scroll up or down.
Also, the Ebay landing page is too cluttered and overwhelming.



5. **Impact Assessment:** 

There is a potential for people to not go back to the Ebay website. Especially if they find a website that is more appealing to the senses and more organized. From personal experience even though I shop online for almost everything. I never use Ebay because I always found the website overwhelming.


6. **Recommendations:** 

    My recommendation will be to design a simple and impressive landing page. Then give the user the choice to navigate to their area of interest. Rather than throwing everything and the kitchen sink at the user as soon as they land on the site. It is overwhelming, jarring and creates a sense of confusion and chaos. I have attached two images in the assets file to illustrate the point. I also attached a page after using the inspect feature to edit the page.

7. **Conclusion:** 

In conclusion, I would like to state that I can understand why "Earthform" and "Crafted" won the Webby Awards and not Ebay. Ebay's landing page is overwhelming, disorganized and cluttered. It utilizes some level of heuristics but needs to implement more than a few more to make the site appealing from a UX and UI perspective.
