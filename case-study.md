**Introduction:** Ebay is designed to be a peer-to-peer market, allowing people to sell things without having to have a third party (directly) involved.

1. **Methodology:** The methodology I used to asses the website was to click-through as a new user and see how I would go about using the website. 

1. **Good UX Findings:** What I found to be good UX design for this eBay was that everything seems to serve a purpose and nothing on the page leaves me questioning why it is there. For example, the header makes the page easy to navigate, while the body focuses on products. Another thing I see that is done well is the fact that the website translates well regardless of the screen size.

1. **Bad UX Findings:** To be honest, eBay looks very similar to Amazon and it is very straight forward from the way it used to be. I remember the website being cluttered with so many listings that you didn't know if the website was even safe to use. The only bad UX finding I was able to notice was the "categories" option would leave from the search bar when the width of the screen was below 544px. This is a good feature that I believe should translate better when it comes to smaller screens, instead of removing it completely.

1. **Impact Assessment:** This option would impact the ease of access to items as it broadens the options available to the user which could overwhelm them. For example, if I was looking for wheels for a bike, but I could not put the category for "sporting goods", I will get all kinds of wheels that serve me no purpose.

1. **Recommendations:** Although I was not able to add the button through inspect element (I tried to manipulate the screen size to see if it would hide the "<div id="gh-cat-box">" but nothing was changing in the html from what I could see), I believe making resolutions < 544px have a categories button, instead of a select inside the search bar, would benefit the user experience. 

1. **Conclusion:** After reviewing the eBay website, I believe they have made many improvements along the years to match their main competitor Amazon and it is shown through the amount of sales certain sellers have made. Although I found one thing I didn't like about the site, eBay has managed to make the UX/UI portion of their site more welcoming than it has ever been before.
