## Methodology
Over the span of less than 24hrs, I've tried to utilize and perform the task by using some of the 10 *Nielsen Heuristic* steps to evaluate and competitively analyze the UX/UI design of ebay's *search* functionability, which over the course of this case report, I'll try my best to breakdown as clearly, simply and efficiently as possible. After a simple search term of 'sneakers' in the search function, the literal first item that pops up in the grid amongst a plethora of sneakers, was (drum roll), a *'Volvo VNL 2004-2016 Hood Mirror Chrome With LED Turn Signals'* - screenshot file visible in 'assets' folder.
Here's a little outline:
-Visibility of search results (abbreviated: SR)
-Matching between real world and SR.
-User control/freedom after SR.
-Consistency, accuracy and standards after SR.
-Error prevention after SR.
-Recognition not reattempts after SR.
-Flexibility and efficiency of SR.
-Aesthetic and minimalist design.
-Help users recognize errors, give suggestions after SR.
-Help and documentation after SR.

### Good UX Findings
-Search items -- the majority of, are categorized, and in abundance for the user to have a great choice of options.
-Search items are priced, and upon clicking on each item, the user is able to click on the many more options in terms of size of sneaker, color, availability, and much more.
#### Bad UX Findings
-It's quite a turnoff when the user searches for 'sneakers' and the first item listed amongst the majority, is a car mirror. 
-As the user starts to scroll further down and through their choices, lo' and behold, there's even more VOLVO car parts. Look for another second *screenshot file* in the 'assets' folder, showing three car parts as mentioned. 

##### Impact Assessment
The impact of one of my findings -- for instance, the odd findings of VOLVO car parts popping up for a 'sneakers' search, is that the user will immediately be thrown-off, even log-off the site and go elsewhere to search for sneakers, because there's so many other sneaker sites.

###### Recommendations
I've chosen the sitemaps flow of clickable links to demonstrate how a user would first enter the site, to where the user does a search for 'sneakers' and what results:
1. (https://www.ebay.com/)
2. (https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313&_nkw=sneakers&_sacat=0)
The end result will show what results in a very confusing first listed item, for a VOLVO car part, instead of the very first item being any type of sneaker or shoe.

###### # Conclusion
I've concluded, there's a glitch. Tried the simple search for 'sneakers' a few times again and again, yet there's still *VOLVO car parts* result amongst the list of sneakers. AGAIN, refer to the screenshots in the 'assets' file or click on the links listed above in the previous question.

###### ## Extra
The design and visual aesthetic of the (https://www.ebay.com/) site is just unappealing. Whether you do a search, or the user is just about sticking on landing page.
