1. Introduction:
   Ebay's website has the purpose of selling items to customers as well as putting things up for auction.

2. Methodology:
   Visibility of system status: eBay's check out system is straightforward but overwhelming. You can also tell that even though auctions are a feature that ebay provides, it is not their main focus due to the lack of information and guidance shown on the landing page about it.

   Match between system and the real world: Ebay uses basic language that can help the average user to understand how to use the website. The webpage is also straightforward but crowded.

   User control and freedom: eBay has a simple layout with labels for each button. The user is presented with various options on what to purchase with a prominent shopping cart button on the upper right side of the page.

   Consistency and standards: eBay presents their website with consist features with images, a favorite button and an add to cart option. However, depending on where you are in the website, the button locations can vary.

   Error prevention: eBay has confirmation screens that can help the user feel secure with their purchases.

   Recognition rather than recall: The website uses standard buttons that is recogizable across various websites such as the saved button with a heart, a magnifying glass to search anything as well as the bell for notifications.

   Flexibility and efficiency of use: The website is easy to use as it features standard functionality for the average user whose purpose of visiting the website is to purchase products.But the auction option is not clear enough to use unless you have been a user who has used it before.

   Aesthetic and minimalist design: eBay shows a standard layout with buttons that are made for the purpose of functionality. However, the amount of content that they display at a time is overwhelming however, I can understand how they would do that on purpose with the intentions of keeping user retention.

   Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: eBay offers assistance via a button that says "Help & Contact" on the upper left corner. It shows that they prioritize being able to help users. With the additional help of a chat with an AI or virtual assistants.

   Help and documentation: Even though they offer help through a button, it is not sufficient enough especially if they want to attract a wide variety of consumers.

3. Good UX findings:
   eBay makes shopping easy with lots of details about the products that they offer. They also have a search bar that helps simplify searching for items to buy. Their checkout process is also pretty standard where they show what you have in your cart, the subtotal and the total of the entire cart

4. Bad UX findings:
   eBay's website can be confusing. The way things look and work can be different when you're in different parts of the website.Since they are a desktop first app, their mobile app design isn't the best.

5. Impact Assessment:
   The effects that bad UX on eBay can cost them a low conversion. Having a hard time navigating a website can turn them away and prompt them to find a more simple website where the steps to find an items and place it for checkout would take a shorter time.

6. Recommendations:
   I would recommend for ebay to have a virtual assistant, an efficient check out system and a better mobile app. The virutal assistant would help anyone who is having trouble with using the app. An efficient check out system would allow first time users to return since they see that the app can be reliable. Meanwhile, having an improved mobile app can boost user retention since having a mobile app can encourage user to browse while on the go.
