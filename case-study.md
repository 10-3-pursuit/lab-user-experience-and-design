1. **Introduction:**
>The purpose of [Ebay.com](http://ebay.com) is for sellers and customers to browse the store for things they are looking to buy and sell. 

 2. **Methodology:**
 From the Nielsen's Heuristics: 10 Usability Heuristics of UI design, what I found that the website utilized was:
  - Visibility of system status: The website does keep users informed because of its layout when the user first enters the website. The sale component, if any any, is displayed on the header. Followed by images of top deals from sellers sliding throughout the page. 
 
 - Match b/w system and the real world: The webite does have some components that would mimic using things in real life such as truning pages could be similar to swiping back and forth on the webpage. 

 - Consistency and Standards: The website does possess the same features and icons similar to other shopping sites that I have viewed. Those icons would be a shopping cart, sign in and register feature, help and contact feature, and an alarm icon (which can be used for notifications once signed in.). Another feature is the layout of the webpage. It consist of a header with important information on the top, different category tabs, slideshow of important infromation, deals, etc. and a search bar. 

 - Error Prevention: The website does contain error prevention features, for the shopper and sellers. The user can delete items in their carts. The seller can delete items they uploded to sell. 

 - Recognition rather than recall: The website does have features and icons that make it easier/quick for users to find what they need. The heart icon is the saved feature, that will show a list of all items the user lived. Also, once signed in, the user can see automatic recommendations of new items based on their previous searches and tehy can see what they searched before, as it would pop up as typing it in the search bar. 

 - Flexibility and efficency of use: Overall I would rate the the design of the application to be a 10, for experienced and inexperienced users. The application feature to change the language is not anywhere on the top of the page, which would be the only con for nonenglish users. 

 - Help and documentation- The website does have steps to uploading items to sells for the sellers. 

**Good UX Findings:**

- The website does really well with recommending items that a user will save in the cart, once the item unfortuntely gets sold. 

 **Bad UX Findings:** 
  - A bad UX finding would be the language feature not being something that shows up on the webpage when a user first enters the site. On the mobile app the feature doesn't show up as well. The langauge feature is all the way at the bottom of the page. 


  **Impact Assessment:**
  _ Not having the language feature pop up when a user first enters the site whether it is the fisrt time through their mobile device or on a public desktop, could cause barriers for the user. The user will need to either look for the icon to chnage the language on the webpage or google the shortcut for the website for that langauge ['ex. user may google ebay in spanish and the shortcut webiste would be ebay.es]

   **Recommendations:**
 - To fix the langauge issue would consist of two things: 1. creating an auto default notification for new users that will prompt them to choose the language of their choice. English will be auto-selected, so the user would have to change it by clicking other languages. 
  2. Another option would be to have the langauge icon on the top left side corner of the page. Ebays langauge icon consist of an image dropdown icon of the United States flag.

 **Conclusion:** 
- Overall, I found the analysis on ebay.com to be very easy since I already use the app. Alot of key features that I exaimed, were some of the reasons why I go to ebay.com. I can now understand from a users perspective which things works well to attract future users. Nowadays, since we have the aility to view websites on a mobile device, we also have an opportunity to view webpages in a similar form than a traditional desktop website.
