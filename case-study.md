## Introduction
Ebay is an e-commerce site that allows users to buy and sell goods. I will be exploring the landing page of the site.

## Methodology
I will use the 10 Nielsen's Heuristics to evaluate the landing page of Ebay.

## Good UX Findings


## Bad UX Findings
User control and freedom: Ebay has an active/moving banner that advertises different products for purchase. Instead of allowing the user to navigate the products being shown, Ebay displays different products to the user by force.
