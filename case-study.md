# Case Study Report: Enhancing eBay's Shopping Cart Icon Visibility

## Introduction
eBay, one of the world's largest online marketplaces, aims to provide a seamless and efficient shopping experience for millions of users. The website serves as a platform where buyers and sellers from around the world interact, making it crucial for eBay to continually optimize its user interface to enhance usability and encourage user engagement.

## Methodology
In conducting this analysis, we employed a combination of heuristic evaluation, user journey mapping, site research, and click-through assessment to evaluate the eBay website's current user experience and identify opportunities for improvement.

## Good UX Findings
eBay boasts several positive aspects of user experience, including:
1. A comprehensive search functionality: eBay's search bar is prominently placed, allowing users to find products easily.
2. Product filtering options: The website offers a range of filters, such as price range, location, and seller ratings, empowering users to narrow down search results effectively.

## Bad UX Findings
While eBay offers a generally user-friendly experience, there are notable issues surrounding the visibility and engagement of the shopping cart icon. These issues include:
1. **Inadequate Shopping Cart Icon Visibility**: The shopping cart icon, crucial for tracking and managing purchases, is relatively small and often overshadowed by other elements on the page, diminishing its visibility.
   - *Heuristic Violation*: Visibility of System Status - Users may struggle to notice the shopping cart icon, impacting their awareness of the items in their cart.
   - *UX Standard*: Fitts's Law - A larger shopping cart icon would make it easier for users to click on, improving efficiency.

## Impact Assessment
The suboptimal visibility of the shopping cart icon can have far-reaching consequences for both users and eBay's business outcomes. Users may:
- **Abandon Carts**: Users might forget about items in their cart, leading to increased cart abandonment rates.
- **Reduced Engagement**: A less visible cart may result in fewer impulse purchases and a diminished overall shopping experience.
- **Lower Sales**: eBay's revenue may be affected as a result of reduced user engagement and cart utilization.
