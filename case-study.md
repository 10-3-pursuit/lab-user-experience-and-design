## Introduction
Ebay is an e-commerce site that allows users to buy and sell goods. I will be exploring the landing page of the site.

## Methodology
I will use the 10 Nielsen's Heuristics to evaluate the landing page of Ebay.

## Good UX Findings
Visibility of system status: when a user searches for "boots men" at the top of the landing page, the user is shown pictures of different men's boots. This helps the user know that searching for an item name will lead to many results matching that item.

Match between system and the real world: the words "Sign in", "Daily Deal", "Help & Contact", and "Sell" are present in the nav bar at the top of the landing page. A "Sign in" link is now present in almost every website. The words "Help and Contact" link takes the user to a page where they can receive help and also leads them to get the contact information for customer service (from Ebay).

## Bad UX Findings
User control and freedom: Ebay has an active/moving banner that advertises different products for purchase. Instead of allowing the user to navigate the products being shown, Ebay displays different products to the user by force.

Aesthetic and minimalist design: there are a lot of advertised products in the landing page. These competing products take away from each other and from the user's desire to search for an item that they need.

## Impact Assessment
Due to competing elements present in the landing page, users may not be incentivized to stay in the website for longers than 10 seconds, which is the average time consumers typically spend on websites. As a result, Ebay may not be able to convert the web traffic they receive into sales, which hurts EBay's business. Furthermore, customers may not be willing to return to the unaesthetically pleasing website, so Ebay may not have too many returning customers.

## Recommendations
Ebay may benefit from having less elements on the landing page and specifically less products. Ebay may make use of CSS grid to layout their landing page differently, with less advertised products. Here is an example using a low fidelity wireframe: [lofi wireframe of ebay landing page](assets/E93FFA69-0A58-4F77-924A-E6FF8510B6C2.heic)



## Conclusion
Ebay, an e-commerce site, has a lot of products being advertised on their landing page.
