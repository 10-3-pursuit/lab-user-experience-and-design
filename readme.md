# Uesr Experience and Design

User Experience and User Interface are two valuable parts of the software devlopment process.

Take a look at this article on [How Long Users Stay on Websites](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/) as well as [Deceptive Patterns](https://darkpatterns.org/). (_Dark patterns are deceptive designs in a user interface that trick users into doing things._)

Take a look at the sites above and notice what makes these sites successful and an example of good UX and UI. Use the categories from [Nielsenâ€™s Heuristics: 10 Usability Principles To Improve UI Design](https://aelaschool.com/en/interactiondesign/10-usability-heuristics-ui-design/) to confirm the design success.

You've seen examples of a UX Case Study Analysis.

- [Jambb](https://www.finna.wang/jambb)
- [Memento](https://mahsakeyhani.com/memento.html)
- [Perfect Recipes App](https://blog.tubikstudio.com/case-study-recipes-app-ux-design/)

In your ` case-study.md`` file, create a mini UX Case Study.
Use the  `assets` folder for any images that you want to include.

### Objective:

Critically analyze the [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/) website to identify bad UX practices and propose actionable improvements. You will use the same Heuristic Principles as you did above to help you with identify why parts of the site are bad UX.

### Report Writing

User `markdown` to prepare a mini UX case report with the following structure:

1. **Introduction:** Brief description of the website's purpose.
1. **Methodology:** Outline the methods used for analysis (e.g., heuristic evaluation, user journey mapping).
1. **Good UX Findings:** Highlight what the website does well, with specific examples. (if you use screenshots include them in the assets folder)
1. **Bad UX Findings:** Detail the UX issues found, with screenshots and references to heuristic principles or other UX standards.
1. **Impact Assessment:** Discuss the potential impact of the bad UX on user behavior and business outcomes.
1. **Recommendations:** Provide specific, actionable recommendations for how the bad UX can be improved. (you may include sitemaps to show a better, click thru, wireframes if you want to demonstrate a different layout, even creating screenshots after editing their site using the Browser Inspector tools to change the CSS and HTML)
1. **Conclusion:** Summarize the key points and any overall insights gained from the analysis.
