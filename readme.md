## Instructions

### Part 1 - Introduction

User Experience and User Interface are two valuable parts of the software devlopment process. You've learned about [User Experience](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ux-user-experience)

Take a look at this article on [How Long Users Stay on Websites](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/) as well as [Deceptive Patterns](https://darkpatterns.org/). (_Dark patterns are deceptive designs in a user interface that trick users into doing things._)

### Part 2 - Research

The Webby Awards is presented by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences (IADAS) and is the leading international award honoring excellence on the Internet. (resource: https://www.webbyawards.com/about/)

#### Good UX/UI

Below are two links to examples of Good UX/UI. They are the 2023 Winners of the [Webby Awards](https://www.webbyawards.com/). One in the _Shopping & Retail Websites and Mobile Sites_ category & the other in the _Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Websites and Mobile Sites_ category respectively.

1. [Earthform](https://basement.studio/)

1. [Crafted](https://experiencecrafted.com/)

Take a look at the sites above and notice what makes these sites successful and an example of good UX and UI. Use the categories from [Nielsenâ€™s Heuristics: 10 Usability Principles To Improve UI Design](https://aelaschool.com/en/interactiondesign/10-usability-heuristics-ui-design/) to confirm the design success.

#### Case Studies

Below are examples of a UX Case Study Analyses.

Investigate and note the structure of or more of these Case Studies

### Part 3 - Case Report Writing

In your ` case-study.md` file, use `markdown` to prepare a mini UX case report. Do not try to comment on the whole site, just pick one portion of the site that you could improve. (e.g. landing page, navigation, call to action) _Remember how Asana focused on one small feature, Goals Feature_

Use the `assets` folder for any images that you want to include.

#### Format

The report should loosely have the following structure:

1. **Introduction:** Brief description of the website's purpose.
1. **Methodology:** Outline the methods used for analysis (e.g., [heuristic evaluation](https://aelaschool.com/en/interactiondesign/10-usability-heuristics-ui-design/), user journey mapping, site research, click-thru and assess....)
1. **Good UX Findings:** Highlight what the website does well, with specific examples. (if you use screenshots include them in the assets folder)
1. **Bad UX Findings:** Detail the UX issues found, with screenshots and references to heuristic principles or other UX standards.
1. **Impact Assessment:** Discuss the potential impact of the bad UX on user behavior and business outcomes.
1. **Recommendations:** Provide specific, actionable recommendations for how the bad UX can be improved.
   You may, for example:
   - include sitemaps to demonstrator better navigation options
   - include wireframes or low-fi mockups if you want to demonstrate a different layout
   - create screenshots after manually editing the ebay site using the Browser Inspector tools to change the CSS and HTML
1. **Conclusion:** Summarize the key points and any overall insights gained from the analysis.
1. **Extra:** You may also include any other categories that you have seen in your research from other Case Analyses

There is no perfect report so do your best to be specific, clear and make good, actionable suggestions. It does not need to be as extensive as the examples that were provided.

\*\* Remember to use tools such as `spell check` and `grammar check` on your report.
